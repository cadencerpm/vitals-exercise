# Live Coding Prompt

You have a small service that ingests blood pressure readings, stores them, and generates alerts.

## Part 1 — Bug fix
Run tests. At least one test fails. Fix the bug so tests pass.

## Part 2 — Extension
Patients with abnormal readings should be notified to retake their vitals. Design and implement this feature.

## Goals:
- correctness + tests
- readable, maintainable design
- discuss tradeoffs + product thinking
- show how you use AI tools effectively - use whichever coding agents you want!
